# Crowdfunding_ETL
Submitted by Kaylyn Valdez-Scott and Alyshia Kiczma Date: 14-NOV-2023 Project Title: Project 2, Crowdfunding ETL

Purpose of project is to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

Through extraction and after transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV files data to create an ERD and a table schema for SQL. 

For Jupyter Notebook containing extraction and transformation work- see file labeled 'ETL_Mini_Project_AKiczma_KValdezScott.ipynb'
This notebook contains codes for reading excel sheets, taking that information and transforming them into DataFrames, and pulling certain information from the DataFrames. Finally, we export this information into CSV files. 

For CSV files created from the Jupyter Notebook, visit the Resources Folder- there you will find files labeled 'category.csv', 'subcategory.csv', 






These notebooks will take a closer look into collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and visually communicating insights.

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
